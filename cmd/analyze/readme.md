### Analyzes a single file or a directory of files and outputs an annotated ptn.

## About
  This is a command line way to analyze a given ptn, that doesn't require the standard console. It can also work (slowly) through a directory.

  All the files output are in standard ptn format, so may be used in any standard PTN viewer / browser.

## Method

Overall, this uses the methods defined in the analysis library of this repository. For more details about these functions, please see the analysis readme: [[takanalysis][takanalysis doc]]
